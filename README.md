## Key takeaways for future projects
Some improvements to be made for future projects is probably using something like next.js for optimizing load speeds. There is no need for CSR in this specific application considering there not being a demand for instant refreshes of the menu for example. So it may have been more optimal to use something like SSG to decrease the initial load time. I cloud also have used css modules to ease the process of making css selectors. I also need to fix some naming convention inconsistencies that sort of messed up the Git, netlify and Windows connections because of case sensitivity differences in the different softwar.
